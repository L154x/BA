  abstract = {The aim of this study was to determine whether the addition of interactivity to a computer-based learning package enhances the learning process. A sample of 33 (22 male and 11 female) undergraduates on a Business and Management degree used a multimedia system to learn about the operation of a bicycle pump. The system consisted of a labelled diagram of the pump, followed by a description of twelve stages in its operation. The sample was randomly divided into two groups who used either an interactive (I) or a non-interactive (NI) version involving both images and text. The I system differed from the NI system by the incorporation of control of pace, self-assessment questions and an interactive simulation. Students then undertook two different types of tests to assess their learning: one designed to evaluate their memory by recalling facts from the lesson, and another designed to assess their understanding through solving novel diagnostic problems. Students using the I system outperformed those using the NI system in the problem-solving test, and needed less time to complete both memory and problem-solving tests. This result is consistent with the hypothesis that interactive systems facilitate deep learning by actively engaging the learner in the learning process. This suggests that educational designers who seek to foster deep learning (as opposed to mere factual recall) should adopt the incorporation of interactivity as a design principle.},

"This result is consistent with the hypothesis that interactive systems facilitate deep learning by actively engaging the learner in the learning process. This suggests that educational designers who seek to foster deep learning (as opposed to mere factual recall) should adopt the incorporation of interactivity as a design principle." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_82XCDAGY/1}{Evans and Gibbons 2007:1147})

"When the teaching material takes the form of a multimedia computer system, two forms of student-content interactions can be distinguished: those initiated by the student, and those initiated by the computer system (Schar \& Krueger, 2000). In the former, the student seeks some information from the content in a similar way to looking something up in a book or watching a television programme. In the latter, the system requires some input from the learner, such as pressing a button or answering a question by clicking on one of a number of options." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_82XCDAGY/2}{Evans and Gibbons 2007:1148})

"Mayer and Chandler (2001) found a similar result in their study of the effect of simple user interaction. In an experiment to investigate the effects of double presentation, they had two groups of students: for one group, the lesson was interactive and for the other, it was noninteractive. The interactivity took the form of a button which would reveal the next stage of the lesson when pressed. The presentation was given twice in order that they could assess the effect of varying the form of one of the two presentations. They found that both groups' subjective judgements of the difficulty of the interactive and non-interactive lessons were the same. However, the transfer-test scores were significantly higher for the group using the interactive system. The explanation they gave for this was that the ability to interact to control the pace of the double presentation enabled students to reduce the cognitive load on their working memory." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_82XCDAGY/12}{Evans and Gibbons 2007:1158})

"Our study thus provides evidence of an interactivity effect for deep learning (understanding), as shown both by improvement in transfer test scores and reduced time needed to complete transfer test questions." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_82XCDAGY/13}{Evans and Gibbons 2007:1159})}

"Typographical cueing, or the attachment of a specific meaning to a part of a text by displaying it in a way which is different from the rest of the text, is mainly used for accentuating single words, phrases or whole paragraphs" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_Z8RX7HN4/3}{Lee and Boling 1999:16})

"Graphical Images" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_Z8RX7HN4/4}{Lee and Boling 1999:17})

"Simple images are more effective for instruction than complex images. Use graphical images for instructional, motivational, or attention-focusing effects, and not simply for the sake of including them on the screen" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_Z8RX7HN4/4}{Lee and Boling 1999:17})\\
"Color is the most sophisticated and complex of the visible language components for screen design," (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_Z8RX7HN4/5}{Lee and Boling 1999:18})\\

The goal of this article is therefore to clarify the concept of interactivity.

Such a model can help inform research, discussion, and design decisions on interactive multimedia instruction.},

Our review of the available empirical research showed that the answer may not be as straightforward as interactivity advocates would expect." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_53YQIY8Q/1}{Domagk et al 2010:1024})

"interactivity requires two fundamental conditions: (a) at least two participants must interact with each other, and (b) the actions of these participants must include an element of reciprocity. Reciprocity means that change occurs on both sides; the actions of one party trigger responses from the other, which lead in turn to changes in the first."

The standard answer to the problems of too much choice, disorientation, and complex navigation is thought to lie in the way we design the interactivity in a system. Unfortunately, the theory of interactivity is at an early stage of development. After critiquing the decision cycle model of interaction \textendash{} the received theory in human computer interaction \textendash{} I present arguments and observational data to show that humans have several ways of interacting with their environments which resist accommodation in the decision cycle model. These additional ways of interacting include: preparing the environment, maintaining the environment, and reshaping the cognitive congeniality of the environment. Understanding how these actions simplify the computational complexity of our mental processes is the first step in designing the right sort of resources and scaffolding necessary for tractable learner controlled learning environments.},

This approach should be based on general human-computer interaction principles as well as educational theory. The paper starts with an overview of the learning process.

In terms of learning efficiency, however, learning from text only was more successful than learning from text and pictures. Interactivity was beneficial for one learning task, but not for the other task. The visualization format affected participants' interaction with pictures, but not the learning outcomes; however this effect was not influenced by interactivity.
