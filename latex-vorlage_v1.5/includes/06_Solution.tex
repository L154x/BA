\chapter{Solution definition} \label{chapter:Solution}
\textbf{roughly 3 pages}

\textit{Show what the artifact is supposed to do}
The objectives of the solution have to be inferred rationally from the problem statement. Therefore the problem should be atomized conceptually, so that the solution can capture its complexity.



\section{Objectives}

\subsection{Dashboard content}
\textit{What exactly should the dashboard visualize?}
State the requirements that come from the requirements analysis

\subsection{Technology for dashboard development}
\begin{itemize}
    \item What should the technology be able to do? What are the requirements? (Should come from the interviews)
    \item What possible technologies are there to build a dashboard? 
    \item Compare these techs with respect to the formulated requirements and choose a solution/combination(?)
\end{itemize}
