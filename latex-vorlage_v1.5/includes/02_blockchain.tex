\section{What is Blockchain?} \label{sec:Blockchain}

\section{What are transactions?} \label{sec:TX}

Inspect transactions in detail, show how they are broadcast and put into blocks
-> only in ethereum or bitcoin or should I inspect the overall design of transaction by looking at different coins?

\section{What are smart contracts?} \label{sec:SmartContracts}

-> here also, only on ethereum or also others? What about legally binding smart contracts?
