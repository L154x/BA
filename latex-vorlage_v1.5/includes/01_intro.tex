\section{Problem statement} \label{sec:Problem}


Show the motivation: Why is this topic important and interesting?

Describe the context of the problem: People don't understand blockchain and how transactions work, therefore they cannot imagine possible use cases as easily.

\section{Objective and scope} \label{sec:Objective}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Touch on the hype on Blockchain and take away the mystery/have people understand how it works and when it may be useful in order to not have inflated expectations.
    \item Say why I want to create an artifact to provide more details about blockchain technology
    \item Limit the scope of the research to only transactions (and one/a few selected coin/s(?))
    \item Articulate the research question that I want to explore in this thesis: How can blockchain transactions and smart contracts best be explained in a dashboard to persons that have only very limited knowledge about this topic?
    \item On basis of this research question, show which research method is going to be used for finding the answer.
    
    Objective should only be 2 to 3 sentences long!
    
\end{itemize}
