\section{Exemplary demonstration \textit{with new students} for \textit{use case}} \label{sec:demo}

\section{Evaluation}

evidence that the artifact is useful

validity, utility, quality, efficacy; Purposeful? and implementability?

\section{Identification of possible optimizations} \label{sec:Optimizations}

How could the artifact be refined? As Design Science Research is an iterative process -> will lead to further research for the future.
